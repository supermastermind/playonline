            This puzzle game is inspired by vintage logic and deduction games popular in the 1970s such as "Super Master Mind" (*).<br>
            During the game, each of your attempts is compared to what the optimal strategy would have played, which can help you to progress.<br>
            At each attempt, the number of possible codes is displayed, and the lists of possible codes are shown at game end.<br>
            Several displays (with colors or numbers) and modes (from 3 to 7 columns and from 5 to 10 colors/numbers) are possible.<br>
            Game scores are stored online to rank players and follow their progression.<br>
            (*) This game is an independent creation and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the trademark owner of "(Super) Master Mind".

            <h2>Game rules</h2>
            The goal of this code-breaking game is to discover a secret code made up of 5 colors randomly selected from a pool of 8, with duplicate colors allowed.<br>
            The player makes successive attempts to guess the secret code.<br>
            After each attempt, feedback is provided using pegs:<br>
            <ul style='margin:0'>
            <li style='list-style-type:disc'>a black peg <small><small>&#x26ab;</small></small> indicates a correct color in a correct position,</li>
            <li style='list-style-type:disc'>a white peg <small><small>&#x26aa;</small></small> indicates a correct color in a wrong position.</li>
            </ul>
            Only the total numbers of black pegs and of white pegs are shown (no information is given about which positions they refer to).<br>
            The game is won when the player receives 5 black pegs (meaning the secret code has been correctly guessed), or lost when the maximum number of attempts is reached.
            <hr style="height:0.5rem; visibility:hidden;" />
            In variants, code breaker games follow the format M out of N, where M is the code length and N is the number of available colors.<br>

            <a name='Strategy'></a>
            <h2>Strategy evaluation: scores and performances</h2>
            Behind the graphical interface, the program is assisted by a calculator which provides hints to help you understand the optimal strategy.
            <hr style='height:0.5rem; visibility:hidden;' />
            This calculator compares what you played to what the optimal strategy would have played. For each code played,
            it compares "the average number of attempts to find secret codes" which is reachable when an optimal code is played
            to this same average number when your code is played, and then displays the difference next to your code, called <b><font color=#CC0099>performance</font></b>.<br>
            <hr style='height:0.5rem; visibility:hidden;' />
            For example:<br>
            <ul style='margin:0'>
              <li style='list-style-type:disc'><b>0.00</b> means that what you played was optimal: no difference between your code and the optimal code(s),</li>
              <li style='list-style-type:disc'><b><font color=#F00000>-1.00</font></b> means that what you played was useless: 1 attempt was lost on average, hence -1,</li>
              <li style='list-style-type:disc'><b><font color=#F00000>-0.50</font></b> means that what you played was not optimal: you lost 0.5 attempt on average
              to reach secret codes in comparison to an optimal code. That means that if the optimal strategy reaches
              secret codes in 4 attempts on average, your code (followed by an optimal strategy) will reach them in 4.5 attempts on average.
              Of course, if you are lucky, your inefficient code might turn out to be the secret code, meaning you would win instantly!
            </ul>
            <hr style='height:0.5rem; visibility:hidden;' />
            When you win, summing those performances over all the codes you played gives your <b><font color=#CC0099>global performance</font></b> for this game.
            <hr style='height:0.5rem; visibility:hidden;' />
            Your <b><font color=#CC0099>score</font></b> for this game is also calculated, based solely on the number of attempts it took you to find the secret code and the time you needed. As a general rule, this <b><font color=#CC0099>score</font></b> is <b>more influenced by luck than your <font color=#CC0099>global performance</font></b>, which better reflects how well you played this game.
            <hr style='height:0.5rem; visibility:hidden;' />
            Online scoreboards display both values (<b><font color=#CC0099>score</font></b> and <b><font color=#CC0099>global performance</font></b>) for each game, as well as cumulative totals for sets of 5 consecutive games, to rank players.
